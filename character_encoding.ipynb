    "\n",
    "Character encodings are particular sets of guidelines for translating raw binary byte sequences (which resemble the following: 0110100001101001) into characters that constitute human-readable text (like \"hi\"). There are numerous different encodings, and attempting to read text into a different one from the one it was originally typed in would result in \"mojibake,\" which is jumbled text (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here is an illustration of mojibake:æ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\n",
    "\n",
    "You can potentially get a character that is \"unknown.\" When there isn't a mapping between a given byte and a character in the encoding you're using to read your byte string in, the following is what is printed:����������\n",
    "\n",
    "Character encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it's definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 is the standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It's when things aren't in UTF-8 that you run into trouble."
